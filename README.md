Version 3 : what's new?
Fixed some bugs that caused service errors
A custom button has been added. In the file 'things.txt' you can write your own actions that this button will perform. You can read more about this in the User Guide section of the script.
Added installer. Now you can install the program, its copy will be placed in the /bin folder of your system. After that, you can run it from any directory

v2 : what's new?
Fixed a bug that prevented the program from closing from the menu

A new tool has been added - deleting metadata from a photo. You can read the instructions right inside the program

Added forced startup. Now you can not watch a tedious picture with the dependency check constantly in the beginning, but just add the key -f when you run the script!

Added a check for updates at startup. Now you can keep up with program updates without having to check the repository :)
