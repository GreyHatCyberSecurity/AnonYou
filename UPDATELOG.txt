What's new in AnonYou v2
------------------------
1. Fixed a bug that prevented the program from closing from the menu
2. A new tool has been added - deleting metadata from a photo. You can read the instructions right inside the program 
3. Added forced startup. Now you can not watch a tedious picture with the dependency check constantly in the beginning, but just add the key -f when you run the script!
4. Added a check for updates at startup.
Now you can keep up with program updates without having to check the repository :)
